# rocprim_radix_sort
Extracted standalone radix_sort from rocPRIM, with example test executable.

See rocPRIM's README on how to build this: https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocPRIM/blob/develop/README.md.  The requirements and instructions are the same for this standalone.  To build the test, you can run the install script (./install -c).
